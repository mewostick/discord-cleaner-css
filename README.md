# Discord Cleaner in CSS
The following CSS files will reduce the amount of clutter Discord has gotten in the last few years (only FULLY works with US/UK English).

The cleaner.css does hide:
+ profile effects (no more unreadable profiles!)
+ avatar decorations
+ send a gift + apps button on the chat bar
+ some Nitro or other ads (those may return after a Discord update)

There is also a CSS file meant for small screens/windows. It's not perfect but usable! The changes are following:
+ optimized the width of icons in the app so they leave more space for text
+ decreased the width of the left sidebar
+ removed the GIFs + stickers buttons in the chat bar. Those are present in the emoji button

Preview for the smallscreen variant:
